This app allows you to predict the bioactivity towards inhibiting the Acetylcholinesterase enzyme. Acetylcholinesterase is a drug target for Alzheimer's disease.

Credits
App built in Python + Streamlit
Descriptor calculated using PaDEL-Descriptor [Read the Paper].
Data: ChEMBL database was used for bioactivity data.
Tools: The app was developed using Conda for environment management and RDKit for cheminformatics.
Inspiration and guidance taken from the tutorial and work by Data Professor for the development of this project.
